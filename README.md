# Node API - Client

This repo is dedicated to client-side's code of [node-api](https://github.com/jlozovei/node-api). Put simply, our client-side will render a fancy UI, created with [vuejs](https://vuejs.org) to generate some data and pass it through ajax requests to our [server-side](https://github.com/jlozovei/node-api-server).
